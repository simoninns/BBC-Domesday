# BBC-Domesday
The original source code for the BBC Domesday system (Acorn AIV) taken from an Archimedes A500 development machine used at Logica in the 80s.  Note that the current BCPL source is the version for the Archimedes which is modified from the original BBC Acorn Master machine used in the AIV set-up.

All BCPL files have been renamed with .bcpl and batch files (containing star commands) have .txt extensions (the original ARTHUR operating system used on the A500 did not use file extensions (files had 'types' instead).  The batch files contain the original commands for compiliing the software using the A500.

Note that the 'ut' directory contains .asm files that form the assembly language drivers for supporting things like VFS on the A500.
