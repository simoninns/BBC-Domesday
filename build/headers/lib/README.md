# Source code
This folder contains a mixture of files on the original A500 image - some seem to be generated by the build script and some are pre-made.

It's possible that the pre-made images are created by some other process on the original machine, but I haven't found it yet.

In order for Domesday kernel compilation and link to succeed, these files must be present.
