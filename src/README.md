# Source code
This folder contains the top-level of the BCPL and ARM assembly code for the Domesday system

# File types
In order to preserve file-types within git the following extensions are used:

* .bcpl - A BCPL source file
* .asm - An ARM assembly file
* .obey - A RISC OS 'Obey' file (list of star commands)
* .txt - An ASCII text file

# RISC OS File type mapping
The following mappings should be used to convert file extensions to RISC OS file-types

* .bcpl = &fff (ASCII text)
* .asm = &fff
* .obey = &feb (Obey command file)
* .txt = &fff
